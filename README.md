### Hi, I'm Ademar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer with solid knowledge in Java and I never found it difficult to learn new technologies. I also currently play the role of tech lead in the company I work for, being responsible for helping the team to produce a quality code, spreading knowledge about the architecture and technologies of the company's systems and assisting in architectural decisions.
